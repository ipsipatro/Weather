# WeatherApp
This is a sample project to fetch current weather report. I have created this project using Xcode 12.4 and Swift 5. Using this app you can search for a city and check the weather details. You can add cities to the favourite list by just tapping the '+' sign. You can also delete a city from favourite if would like to.

## Getting Started

First install pods and then open the .xcworkspace file in Xcode to run the app.
