# Weather
This is a sample project to search for a location and find the weather details. I have created this project using Xcode 12.4 and Swift 5. Using this app you can search for a location and check the weather details. You can save locations to your favourite list by just tapping the '+' sign. You can also delete a location from saved locations list.

In this app I have used API call provided by 'https://openweathermap.org' and get all essential weather data for a specific location.

## Getting Started
First install pods and then select on the .xcworkspace file to open the project in xcode to run the app.
